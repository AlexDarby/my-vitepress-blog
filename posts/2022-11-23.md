So, I've been inspired to try and start a fairly frequent link blog-style thing, just to throw some things out there that I have found each day. I'm already in a semi-routine of collecting interesting stuff so I'm going to force it out into the open as well.

First things first, this is the source of the inspiration, an excellent new site influenced by the directory-driven internet of old. [https://ooh.directory/](https://ooh.directory/). Discovered some great resources off this thing already and I've only spent 10 minutes on it.

I've been continuing to enjoy the [Philosophy Tube](https://www.youtube.com/@thephilosophytube) channel. In particular, over the last couple of days I've been through the episodes on [Antisemitism](https://youtu.be/KAFbpWVO-ow) and [Capital Punishment](https://youtu.be/TDcwIZzaf-k). They are very well made/written and the channel has piqued my interest in Philosophy for sure.

Cool. That'll do for today :).
