So the combination of good dev docs for Rails, combined with being able to ask ChatGPT technical questions and get a good descriptive answer has been a bit of a game-changer. I've been getting up to speed with the framework as well as getting well-laid-out answers on Ruby itself and it's been a very pleasant experience. If you have ever been curious to try out a new language or framework, the combination of [Devbox](https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox) and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a compelling reason to go for it. 

I intend on using this combination more aggressively at work as it's a powerful tool to accelerate your progress. 

Speaking of Accelerate, I've been having issues calculating [DORA](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) metrics at work. I have been using a chunky [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)/Python script to calculate everything but it's reached a fairly high degree of complexity, such that it's a bit of a pig to maintain. There are tools out there to purchase, but I haven't done the rounds recently to see if any of them are worthwhile.
