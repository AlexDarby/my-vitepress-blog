It's been an interesting day so far. I'm continuing across all fronts with some language learning. Slightly concerned I am spread far too thinly across many disciplines. Firstly I've been continuing to tinker with Elixir/Phoenix which is a very compelling and feature-rich stack to work with. Plugging away at the course as well as with a little semi-serious rework of this site. Not sure if I'll keep the momentum to finish this but it's feeling nice to work with so far.

Spent a little bit of the day working with some dotnet core as well. There is something to be said for working within the same domain as the rest of your team, in terms of future support for any tooling you create. How is a team going to maintain that one super-critical Python script if it's not a Python house? ChatGPT has been helping me here, mostly with syntax as I'm concerned it is leading me down the garden path in terms of its overall implementation approach.

Finally, as if that weren't enough I encountered [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/) today, which appears to offer a complete web app ecosystem, purely in Python. Have things come full circle? is it time for me to revert back to the warm safety of Python to achieve absolutely everything? ... possibly. A test run of Pynecone is incoming I think... just don't tell Phoenix. It'll be our little secret.
