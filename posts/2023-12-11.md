There haven't been many things I've seen this year that have been better than the [Jeff Bezos Rowing Boat](https://youtu.be/VGhcSupkNs8?si=ZfVkIaPnGtcZT4IS). There isn't much else to say.

One thing that might come close is the wonderful [Tom Cardy](https://youtu.be/ZjlYFWLUDBQ?si=XqNCwlzfXa46J4fK). This video I watched every day for a significant length of time. It has been singular in inspiring me to give D&D a go.

I've been massively enjoying the new [Rick Rubin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/1838858636) book. While it has a bit of a style to it that might not appeal to some, for me it touches on some really important concepts in a way that is direct, eloquent, and imaginative. I'm back on here doing this, so you partly have Rick to thank for that.

Thats all for now.
